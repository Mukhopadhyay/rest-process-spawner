# rest-process-spawner
Example scenario of executing lengthy functions using python Rest APIs and processes.

## Description
The server is written in [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). But the idea works for FastAPI, flask alike. No async is used in this project. 

Note: I was stuck for some case like this some time back, so putting it up on my page, in case anyone finds this helpful :D

## Starting the server
```bash
uvicorn app:app
```
